A basic arithmetic task implemented with PsychoPy.

This repository has two PsychoPy tasks: `training.py` and `arithmetic_task.py`.

The script `training.py` is used for out-of-scanner training to ensure that participants understand the task.

The script `arithmetic_task.py` is the in-scanner task.
This task has two runs of 7.5 minutes.
